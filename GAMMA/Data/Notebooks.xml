He joined with Paladin Griffon’s squad since they seemed to be the most reckless, meaning that he would get more frequent opportunities at repairs, even if they were just simple field repairs with his trusty hammer.&#xD;&#xA;" />

The Performance Guild of Delitel has the strongest presence here, as little of the ore is actually processed in Nyril, and is instead sent to Kresha for refining, who then distributes the ingots to the other cities for trade.
