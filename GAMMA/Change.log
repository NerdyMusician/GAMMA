Player Character Creation Window
This release includes significant additions and reworks of the Player Character screens
as well as 'Player Building Blocks' such as Player Class, Player Race, etc. Many player character
fields have been transitioned to read-only TextBlock elements instead of TextBox because the
values would be overwritten by the character creation process anyway, and enforces its use.
Various stat bonus fields were added however to still accomodate for one-off rule exceptions or
buffs to player stats and skills.

Significant data rework was done for Player Classes / Races etc to the point where it was
unfortunately not practical to be able to translate data to the new system like what had been
done previously with InventoryModel and SpellLink, so any of that type of data entered into
a 1.23 or earlier system will need to be manually rebuilt. Instead of the individual specific
fields and data sets for those player building blocks, it now utilizes a system of 'Features'
that can have different types and values, which are then processed as a list during character
creation to display appropriate information and fields to the player, and also allowing for
higher variety of customization for homebrew items going forward.
